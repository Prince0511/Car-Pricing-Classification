# 🚗 Car Pricing Classification Project 📊

Goal: Develop a machine learning model to predict car prices based on features 📈

Models used:

K-Nearest Neighbor 🧮
Decision Tree 🌳
Catboost Classifier 🐱
Light Gradient Boosting Classifier 🌟
Classification: Categorize cars into price ranges (low, medium, high) 📉📊📈

Dataset: Large dataset of cars with prices and features 📚

Evaluation: Metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score ⚖️

Application: Assist buyers/sellers in making informed decisions 🛒💰
