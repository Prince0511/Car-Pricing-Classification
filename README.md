# Car-Pricing-Classification

Car Pricing Classification project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a car based on a set of features such as make and model, year, engine size, etc.
Machine Learning Models used in the project are K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Catboost Classifier, and Light Gradient Boosting Classifier.
The goal is to classify the cars into different price ranges, e.g., low, medium, and high, based on the given features. 
The model will be trained on a large dataset of cars and their respective prices and features. 
The model will then be used to make predictions on new, unseen car data. 
The accuracy of the model will be evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
The end goal is to develop a reliable and efficient model that can help people make informed decisions about buying or selling a car.
